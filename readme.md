# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kris Smith @yiczy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis and visualization.

# ðŸŒ± Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me presented in iPython Notebooks.


## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Supervised Learning: Wine Quality & Ratings Bias](https://github.com/yiczy/Wine-Quality/blob/main/Wine%20Quality.ipynb): A Machine Learning model to predict quality of wine based on the chemo-analytic data of a given red wine. This model identified wine quality in low med high quality classes with 83% Auc with High possiblity of improvement by Tree Depth and width.
	- [Unsupervised Learning, DTW: Crypto Currency](https://github.com/yiczy/DTW/blob/main/FinancialTimeSeriesClusteringDTW.ipynb): Applying Dynamic Time Warping to cluster Crypto Currencies as an alternative to correlation measurments of similarity to better identify occurance of decoupling of tokens from Bitcoin.

- ### Optimization

	- [ProBanker: Banking GAP interest rate Optimization](https://github.com/yiczy/Probanker): A greedy algorithm impementation in ProBanker(https://www.probanker.com/pbshiloh/), a competitive banking simulation.
    -[python]:Please download repository, edit _login_scrip.py_ to include your username and password and then run _python login_scrip.py_
	- [Portfolio Optimization: Risk Measure](https://github.com/yiczy/Portfolio-Optimization):This App uses Robinhood. It is a script that optimizes a portfolio's return to risk by SGD and random samples. Sharpe, Sortino and other risks are measured.
		-[Webapp](https://share.streamlit.io/kss239/streamlit_dashboard_portfolio_opt/main/app.py?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=215986359&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NJI2LSNy5FepUy3lBbQFHTA9Y-0L4BwRF4-YjbKled6tsR0FXLvb-opE1BDcNKkanrXCqBXPCL3IkLOuVwVEPVQ220SSbMg0fSPtn0grUl_aoXF0&utm_content=215986359&utm_source=hs_email): Please download the github files and run locally. This is a nonfunctional hosted app given how streamlit reloads the entire program after every input and so previous AuthO tokens are erased and must be retrieved. (Planned to be moved from Streamlit to Dash)

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization

	- [Liang's Microbial Data](https://github.com/yiczy/Liang-s-Project): Analysis of walkability of suburbs in Melbourne, Victoria and its implications.
    -[Cluster Analysis](https://github.com/yiczy/Liang-s-Project/blob/main/ClusteringProcessing.ipynb): Using Bioinfomatic tools to cluster microbes via t-SNE PCA and UMAP methods
    -[WCNA](https://github.com/yiczy/Liang-s-Project/blob/main/WCNA.ipynb):Using Weighted Correlation Network Analysis
	- [Mini Project: Options](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Playing around with options
    -[Butterfly Options Probability Models](https://github.com/yiczy/Options-Visualizations/blob/main/ButterflyOptions%20Probabilities.ipynb)
    -[Visualizing Options Leverage Surfaces](https://github.com/yiczy/Options-Visualizations/blob/main/OptionLeverageSurface.ipynb)
